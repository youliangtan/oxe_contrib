# MimicPlay

The robot interacts with various appliances in five different scenes, including a kitchen with an oven; a study desk with a bookshelf and lamp; flowers and a vase; toy sandwich making; and cloth folding. It opens the microwave and drawers; places a book on the shelf; inserts a flower into the vase; and assembles a sandwich.
