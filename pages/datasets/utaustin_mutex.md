# Austin Mutex

The Mutex dataset involves a diverse range of tasks in a home environment, encompassing pick and place tasks like "putting bread on a plate," as well as contact-rich tasks such as "opening an air fryer and putting a bowl with dogs in it" or "taking out a tray from the oven and placing bread on it."
