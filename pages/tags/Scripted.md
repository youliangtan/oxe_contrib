# Scripted

- [Robonet](https://github.com/youliangtan/oxe_contrib/tree/main/pages/datasets/robo_net.md): The robot interacts with the objects in a bin placed in front of it
- [VIMA](https://github.com/youliangtan/oxe_contrib/tree/main/pages/datasets/vima.md): The robot is conditioned on multimodal prompts (mixture of texts, images, and video frames) to conduct tabletop manipulation tasks, ranging from rearrangement to one-shot imitation.
- [Stanford_Robocook](https://github.com/youliangtan/oxe_contrib/tree/main/pages/datasets/stanford_robocook_converted_externally_to_rlds.md): In the first task, the robot pinches the dough with an asymmetric gripper / two-rod symmetric gripper / two-plane symmetric gripper. In the second task, the robot presses the dough with a circle press / square press / circle punch / square punch. In the third task, the robot rolls the dough with a large roller / small roller.
- [SPOC](https://github.com/youliangtan/oxe_contrib/tree/main/pages/datasets/spoc.md): The robot navigates in the environment and performs pick and place with open vocabulary descriptions.
- [ConqHose](https://github.com/youliangtan/oxe_contrib/tree/main/pages/datasets/conqhose.md): The robot grabs, lifts, and drags the end of a vacuum hose around in an office environment.
- [MPI_Muscular_Proprioception](https://github.com/youliangtan/oxe_contrib/tree/main/pages/datasets/mpi_muscular_proprioception.md): There is no task that the robot solves. It executes a combination of random multisine signals of target pressures, as well as fixed target pressures.
- [USC_Cloth_Sim](https://github.com/youliangtan/oxe_contrib/tree/main/pages/datasets/usc_cloth_sim_converted_externally_to_rlds.md): The robot manipulates a deformable object (cloth on a tabletop) along a diagonal.
- [Berkeley_RPT_Data](https://github.com/youliangtan/oxe_contrib/tree/main/pages/datasets/berkeley_rpt_converted_externally_to_rlds.md): Picking, stacking, destacking, and bin picking with variations in objects.
- [Maniskill](https://github.com/youliangtan/oxe_contrib/tree/main/pages/datasets/maniskill_dataset_converted_externally_to_rlds.md): The robot interacts with different objects placed on the plane (ground). The tasks include picking an isolated object or an object from the clutter up and moving it to a goal position, stacking a red cube onto a green cube, inserting a peg into the box, assembling kits, plugging a charger into the outlet on the wall, turning on a faucet.
- [UIUC_D3Field](https://github.com/youliangtan/oxe_contrib/tree/main/pages/datasets/uiuc_d3field.md): The robot completes tasks specified by the goal image, including organizing utensils, shoes, mugs.
- [RECON](https://github.com/youliangtan/oxe_contrib/tree/main/pages/datasets/berkeley_gnm_recon.md): Mobile robot explores outdoor environments using a scripted policy
- [CMU_Food_Manipulation](https://github.com/youliangtan/oxe_contrib/tree/main/pages/datasets/cmu_food_manipulation.md): Robot interacting with different food items.
- [Stanford_MaskVIT_Data](https://github.com/youliangtan/oxe_contrib/tree/main/pages/datasets/stanford_mask_vit_converted_externally_to_rlds.md): The robot randomly pushes and picks objects in a bin, which include stuffed toys, plastic cups and toys, etc, and are periodically shuffled.
- [QUT_Dynamic_Grasping](https://github.com/youliangtan/oxe_contrib/tree/main/pages/datasets/qut_dynamic_grasping.md): The robot grasps an object that moves around continuously and randomly along the XY plane. 
- [ASU_TableTop_Manipulation](https://github.com/youliangtan/oxe_contrib/tree/main/pages/datasets/asu_table_top_converted_externally_to_rlds.md): The robot interacts with a few objects on a table. It picks up, pushes forward, or rotates the objects.
