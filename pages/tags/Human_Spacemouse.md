- [Austin_VIOLA](oed-playground/tree/master/pages/datasets/vio.md): The robot performs various household-like tasks, such as setting up the table, or making coffee using a coffee machine. 
- [Austin_Sailor](oed-playground/tree/master/pages/datasets/ustin_sailor_dataset_converted_externally_to_rlds.md): The robot interacts with diverse objects in a toy kitchen. It picks and places food items, a pan, and pot.
- [Berkeley_Autolab_UR5](oed-playground/tree/master/pages/datasets/berkeley_autolab_ur5.md): The data consists of 4 robot manipulation tasks: simple pick-and-place of a stuffed animal between containers, sweeping a cloth, stacking cups, and a more difficult pick-and-place of a bottle that requires precise grasp and 6DOF rotation
- [Austin_Sirius](oed-playground/tree/master/pages/datasets/ustin_sirius_dataset_converted_externally_to_rlds.md): The dataset comprises two tasks, kcup and gear. The kcup task requires opening the kcup holder, inserting the kcup into the holder, and closing the holder. The gear task requires inserting the blue gear onto the right peg, followed by inserting the smaller red gear.
- [Austin_Mutex](oed-playground/tree/master/pages/datasets/utaustin_mutex.md): The Mutex dataset involves a diverse range of tasks in a home environment, encompassing pick and place tasks like "putting bread on a plate," as well as contact-rich tasks such as "opening an air fryer and putting a bowl with dogs in it" or "taking out a tray from the oven and placing bread on it."
- [Austin_BUDS](oed-playground/tree/master/pages/datasets/ustin_buds_dataset_converted_externally_to_rlds.md): The robot is trying to solve a long-horizon kitchen task by picking up pot, placing the pot in a plate, and push them together using a picked-up tool.
