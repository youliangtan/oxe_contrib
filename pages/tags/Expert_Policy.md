- [QT-Opt](https://github.com/youliangtan/oxe_contrib/tree/main/pages/datasets/kuka.md): Kuka robot picking objects in a bin.
- [CoryHall](https://github.com/youliangtan/oxe_contrib/tree/main/pages/datasets/berkeley_gnm_cory_hall.md): Small mobile robot navigates hallways in an office building using a learned policy.
- [Saytap](https://github.com/youliangtan/oxe_contrib/tree/main/pages/datasets/utokyo_saytap_converted_externally_to_rlds.md): A Unitree Go1 robot follows human command in natural language (e.g., "trot forward slowly")
- [UCSD_Pick_Place](https://github.com/youliangtan/oxe_contrib/tree/main/pages/datasets/ucsd_pick_and_place_dataset_converted_externally_to_rlds.md): The robot performs pick and place tasks in table top and kitchen scenes. The dataset contains a variety of visual variations.
- [DLR_Sara_Pour_Dataset](https://github.com/youliangtan/oxe_contrib/tree/main/pages/datasets/dlr_sara_pour_converted_externally_to_rlds.md): The robot learns to pour ping-pong balls from a cup held in the end-effector into the cup placed on the table.
- [SACSoN](https://github.com/youliangtan/oxe_contrib/tree/main/pages/datasets/berkeley_gnm_sac_son.md): Mobile robot navigates pedestrian-rich environments (e.g. offices, school buildings etc.) and runs a learned policy that may interact with the pedestrians.
- [Stanford_Kuka_Multimodal](https://github.com/youliangtan/oxe_contrib/tree/main/pages/datasets/stanford_kuka_multimodal_dataset_converted_externally_to_rlds.md): The robot learns to insert differently-shaped pegs into differently-shaped holes with low tolerances (~2mm).
